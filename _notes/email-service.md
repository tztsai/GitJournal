To let users create a personal email address under your domain (e.g., username@ruminer.app) for receiving newsletters ‚Äî which you can ingest, process with AI, and summarize into a weekly report ‚Äî you need a system that handles:
	1.	Programmatic email address creation
	2.	Newsletter email reception & storage
	3.	Email ingestion to your processing pipeline
	4.	AI summarization & digest delivery

Here are the best options and tools across that pipeline:

‚∏ª

‚úÖ 1. Email Address Creation under ruminer.app

You want to offer something like user123@ruminer.app. This requires:
‚úÖ Resend  
	‚Ä¢	Best choice if you want minimal setup, full control, and a clean dev experience
	‚Ä¢	Excellent for both inbound (newsletters) and outbound (AI summaries)
	‚Ä¢	Easy to integrate into your ingestion and AI pipeline
	‚Ä¢	You must build the logic for parsing, user-matching, and spam filtering ‚Äî but they provide the tools

‚úÖ Mailgun
	‚Ä¢	Powerful, widely used in production
	‚Ä¢	Slightly more complex routing and parsing than Resend
	‚Ä¢	Better built-in spam protection and analytics
	‚Ä¢	Good if you already use Mailgun or need more enterprise-grade routing

‚∏ª

‚úÖ 2. Email Ingestion for Newsletters

Once the emails land, you need to extract and store their content.

Tools & Strategies:
	‚Ä¢	Mailparser.io or Parseur (hosted): Extract structured data from incoming emails
	‚Ä¢	Cloudflare Email Routing ‚Üí your webhook server
	‚Ä¢	Mailgun Webhooks: Delivers email content (subject, body, attachments) via HTTP POST
	‚Ä¢	Self-hosted Haraka, Laminar, or Maddy to directly receive and process SMTP

Store:
	‚Ä¢	Subject, sender, timestamp
	‚Ä¢	HTML and plaintext body
	‚Ä¢	Inline and attached media

‚∏ª

‚úÖ 3. AI Pipeline Integration

Each ingested email becomes a content item in your system:
	‚Ä¢	Store it in your database under the corresponding user
	‚Ä¢	Use AI (e.g., OpenAI or Claude) to:
	‚Ä¢	Extract key points
	‚Ä¢	Classify topics
	‚Ä¢	Cluster related emails
	‚Ä¢	Summarize per topic or sender

‚∏ª

‚úÖ 4. Weekly Digest Delivery

Create a scheduled AI-generated report emailed to the user‚Äôs personal inbox (e.g., user@gmail.com):
	‚Ä¢	Run a cron job or scheduled task (e.g., via Temporal, cron, or Supabase Edge Functions)
	‚Ä¢	Summarize based on user preferences
	‚Ä¢	Send via Resend, Mailgun, Postmark, or any SMTP service

‚∏ª

üîß Example Stack (Minimal Effort, Hosted):
	‚Ä¢	Domain: ruminer.app (on Cloudflare or any registrar)
	‚Ä¢	Forwarding: ForwardEmail with wildcard ‚Üí webhook endpoint
	‚Ä¢	Webhook endpoint: Supabase Edge Function / Vercel API Route / your own server
	‚Ä¢	Parsing: Use simple text/html parsing or mailparser (Node.js) or email (Python)
	‚Ä¢	Storage: PostgreSQL + S3 for attachments
	‚Ä¢	AI: OpenAI API, LangChain, or your own summarizer
	‚Ä¢	Weekly report: Cron ‚Üí summary ‚Üí Resend / Mailgun to user inbox
